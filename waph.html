    <p>Till now we have worked on the following labs and hackathon:</p>
    <hr>
    <b>Lab 1:</b>
    <p>As part of this lab1 we have worked on the foundations of web application and used Wireshark tool to analyze the ‘http’ requests. In Part 1 we have got familiarized with wireshark tool where we analyzed http request and response of ‘example.com’ web page by accessing through Google Chrome and telnet command in Ubuntu. The basics of web applications where we created web applications using C, PHP languages. In addition to this the POST request is used to access the a PHP application.</p>
    <hr>
    <b>Lab 2:</b>
    <p>As part of lab 2, we have used various methods to create a Front-end web application. For the front-end web development, a HTML file is used as a base file that create a simple page with static information and forms. To this HTML, JavaScript code and functions are added to display time and clock. Similarly we have added the Ajax and jQuery to retrieve data using asynchronous requests to the echo.php file and display the response on the HTML page. In addition to this we have used CSS to design the HTML and integrated the web page with joke and guessAge APIs.</p>
    <hr>
    <b>Hacakathon 1:</b>
    <p>In the Hackathon 1 we had two tasks - Task 1 is to perform attacks and Task 2 is adding defenses to the code in lab1 and lab2. As part of Task1, we have performed 7 levels of Cross-site scripting attacks on 7 different web pages of different security or defense level. Guessing the source code of the level2- level6 pages was also done in this activity as this would help in the attack. Task 2 is about adding defense code to the existing lab1 and lab2 codes wherever we are getting input from user or APIs.</p>
